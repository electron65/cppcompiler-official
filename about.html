        <h2>What I do...</h2>
        <p>
        Hello, I'm electron65. I am a undergraduate student majoring electronical engineering. I first started blogging after a large project with my friends.
        We made a simple graphic card using FPGA and Arduino. It was very hard to work on but it was worth doing. Like I said ealier, I started blogging to store
        my projects. I may not be posting blog post here, but I will be posting them on Tistory. So Stay tunned!
        </p>

        <h2>cppcompiler background history...</h2>
        
        <p>
        How this website came up was a long story. Here is how it starts. After my hardcore sophomore year 
        (I had hard time catching up because our project was huge! Feat. Simple graphics card and sound card),
        winter vaction came. I was wondering what project I should start. I then thought my childhood years when we were using modems to connect to the internet.
        It would start with a weird sound. After the sound we could use the internet. First, clicking on the browser then typing a domain could get you anywhere.
        I would always wondered how I could get into someones website and also I wanted a cool domain just like the owners website.
        </p>

        <h2>Start of the project...</h2>
        <p>
        So back again to winter vacation, I'd thought first understanding computer networks in a brief manner then ultimately managing a home server and a homepage. 
        So I started with using Linux. From installing Linux to using very basic commands. I then added application by application. 
        Starting with ssh connection using putty, then opening a FTP server, next opening a minecraft server. For a starter, this process was not quite easy. 
        </p>

        <h2>Not possible at home...</h2>
        <p>
        Some hard work of debugging, I later knew it was not so easy to manage a website using a home server. 
        After successfully opening a test homepage on my home server, I still had the urge of wanting a website.
        I first started making a website from scratch with html and css while looking for possible solutions
        </p>

        <h2>First hosting ...</h2>
        <p>
        I first bought a domain(cppcompiler) and searched hosting services for the right condition. 
        Github was one, but at that time I thought I was going to be able to make a dynamic website, so I chose Google cloud.
        After trying some javascript, I soon learned it was to hard to make a dynamic website determined to make a static webpage.
        After successfully making a website from scratch, I launched it on Google cloud on late december 2019.
        </p>

        <h2>Second hosting ...</h2>
        <p>
        I really thought that was the last time I was making a website. 
        However, on may 18th, 2020, I had an idea to add on my homepage. I decided to make a page with links, to make it easier for my friends and relatives to send mails when I go to boot camp. 
        I understood my initial homepage was sloppy and was a static homepage which also meant, I no longer need to host it on google cloud, which would expire in a year.
        On May 19 2020, I hosted a homepage on Github.
        </p>

        <h2>Finally? ...</h2>
        <p>
        However the pages were horrible on small devices like smartphones. I used another whole day in trying to make it compatible on small displays, it was a failure. 
        I didn't think it worthy to further develop and decided to use jekyll and rehost it on Github. 
        I spent a day installing jekyll on windows. After another day of editing, there seemed no hope. So, I later changed the theme from jekyll to bootstrap version.
        </p>

        <h2>The "cppcompiler"</h2>
        <p>
        After numerious trials to get my website online, I finally succeeded hosting the website on May 23, 2020. For me, I think I have came a long way.
        6 months ago I had never imagined the project to come this far. Even though developing websites and hosting online may not be directly related to my major, 
        I actually found a great hobby I might do everytime I'm free. Well yeah, this is how it all started, cppcompiler.
